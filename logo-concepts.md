 Alternatively, we could explore entirely new directions:                  
    - Möbius strip - infinite surface, no beginning or end                  
    - Penrose triangle - impossible geometry, breaking boundaries
    - Golden spiral segment - mathematical beauty, growth                   
    - Torus slice - higher dimensional thinking
