Logo Designer for AI Research Lab

About the Project

Tachyon Labs is launching a new AI research organization dedicated to building safe artificial superintelligence. We need a distinctive visual identity that communicates innovation, scientific rigor, and trustworthiness.

Design Direction

We're inspired by the clean, sophisticated aesthetics of leading AI companies:
• Anthropic (claude.ai)
• Cursor (cursor.com)
• Cognition (cognition.ai)
• Cohere (cohere.com)
• Grok (grok.com)

Requirements

• Minimalist design with excellent scalability
• Equal performance on light/dark backgrounds
• Conceptual depth beyond typography
• Professional yet approachable
• Future-proof aesthetic (5+ year lifespan)
• Subtle reference to speed/acceleration (Tachyon = faster-than-light particle)

Deliverables

• Initial concepts (3-4 options)
• Two revision rounds on selected concept
• Final files: AI, EPS, SVG, PNG (transparent), JPG
• Variations: full color, monochrome, reversed
• Basic brand guidelines
• Favicon and social media adaptations

Ideal Candidate

• 3+ years logo design experience
• Strong tech/AI/research portfolio
• Demonstrated conceptual thinking
• Understanding of current design trends
